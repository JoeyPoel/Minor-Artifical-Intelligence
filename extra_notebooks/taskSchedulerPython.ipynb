    "# Task Scheduler Application\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script implements a task scheduler application. The application allows users to manage their tasks, add new tasks with deadlines and priorities, view upcoming deadlines, mark tasks as completed, and save/load tasks from a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Task**: Users can add a new task with a name, deadline, and priority.\n",
    "- **View Tasks**: Users can view all tasks sorted by priority.\n",
    "- **Mark Task as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed.\n",
    "- **View Upcoming Deadlines**: Users can view upcoming task deadlines.\n",
    "- **Save/Load Tasks**: Users can save their tasks to a file and load them later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script provides example usage at the end, demonstrating how to interact with the task scheduler application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run the script to execute the task scheduler application.\n",
    "- Follow the example usage section to interact with the application and manage tasks.\n"
