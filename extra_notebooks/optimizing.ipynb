    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Application optimization is crucial in an era where large amounts of data need to be processed quickly and efficiently. Traditional CPUs can sometimes fall short when performing intensive tasks such as machine learning, image processing, and data analysis. This is where GPUs, cloud computing, and real-time processing come into play. These technologies can significantly enhance performance and increase scalability.\n",
